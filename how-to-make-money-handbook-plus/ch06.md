# Asset and Passive Income: Quantitative Evaluation of Assets

We can create a quantitative evaluation standard for assets to better understand their status. Below are some commonly used evaluation criteria for reference.

## Input

The input for an asset typically includes three aspects: "people," "money," and "time."

- **People and Time**: This usually refers to ourselves and the time we can dedicate.
- **Money**: We need some initial capital, but it doesn’t require a large investment in fixed assets. With the widespread use of cloud computing, many large websites can reduce costs by renting cloud services. This allows us to be more flexible, avoiding the need to purchase servers and instead renting cloud services to meet our needs.

It’s important to note the **maintenance cost**. While creating an asset may not require a significant financial investment, the maintenance costs are often overlooked. For example, online courses come with maintenance costs. Many people think that once a course is created, they can earn money indefinitely. However, content updates, market competition, and piracy can all affect income. Therefore, when creating an asset, it’s crucial to account for maintenance costs.

## Output

The returns from an asset can be divided into two categories:

- **One-time Return**: For example, the services of a technical consultant. We invest time in preparation, communicating with clients, and once completed, we receive a one-time payment.
- **Recurring Return**: For example, publishing a mini-book on a platform like Juejin. As long as people purchase, it generates ongoing income. While the monthly income may seem small, it accumulates over time. Based on my experience, **the return on investment for Juejin mini-books is the highest**.

## Sustainability

Sustainability is a standard I added later. Many assets cannot generate continuous income forever because market demand changes over time. The lifecycle of an asset may eventually become irrelevant as market needs evolve and may decline. To extend the asset's lifespan, we may need to periodically maintain or update it to ensure it aligns with market demand.

This is not just a time issue but an ongoing process of improvement.

## Risk

The biggest risk programmers face when creating products is "**no one uses it**." Even after learning about demand analysis, many still create products that do not meet market needs. Early projects come with higher risks, but that doesn't mean we should avoid them. Risks can be reduced by adjusting inputs, such as creating a simple MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to test market demand before deciding whether to invest more resources.

## Threshold

Lastly, I introduced the "threshold" evaluation standard. It measures the difficulty of creating an asset with limited resources. Given the constraints of side projects, our resources are often limited, and this standard helps us assess the difficulty of creating an asset under current conditions.
