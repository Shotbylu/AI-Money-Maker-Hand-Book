# Asset and Passive Income: Creating Assets

In the previous section, we discussed how, if assets cannot be acquired through purchases, we can create them directly. For people in other industries, the cost of creating an asset might be similar to purchasing one, but for programmers, the situation is different. We are in the age of software, the internet, and mobile internet, and we can use our technical skills to create various digital and virtual assets at a low cost and with little to no risk, allowing these assets to earn money for us around the clock.

Not everyone has this privilege—programmers are among the few who can control most of the production materials. For most programmers, creating a commercial product is only a step away from adding a bit of finesse and design skills.

Of course, not all virtual assets are suitable for side businesses because each of us has limited resources and energy. So we need to focus on products and services that are best suited for us to develop.

So, which products and services are suitable for side businesses? Here are some thoughts:

## Self-Propagation

The first concept is **self-propagation**. This means that the product itself has a strong attraction, and users will actively recommend it to others after using it. This way, we don’t have to spend too much on marketing.

For most programmers, writing code is just a matter of time and effort. Many people can write code, but fewer can sell it. So, if our product can propagate itself, we can grow without a market budget.

## User-Generated Content (UGC)

The second concept is **User-Generated Content (UGC)**. Simply put, it’s about getting users to help create content, similar to a more extensive form of crowdsourcing. The core goal is to break through the limitations of personal time and energy.

For example, if I run a blog and need to write every article myself, I’ll quickly get exhausted. But if I run an interview-based blog, preparing a fixed list of questions and interviewing people from various fields, users contribute at least half of the content.

If we make it a magazine and invite people to submit articles on a specific theme for each issue, we shift from being the main creator to being an editor. Although the quality of submissions may vary, as long as there are enough submissions, the overall quality won’t suffer, and the volume of content will increase significantly. After all, no matter how hard one person tries, energy is limited.

## Automation

The third category is **automation**. This means that once the product is online, all processes are handled automatically by machines. We don’t need to invest too much time and just pay the cloud platform periodically.

Of course, this is in an ideal scenario, and in reality, various unexpected issues may arise, often clustering together (don’t ask me how I know).

However, in most cases, we won’t have to worry about it—the system runs automatically. Such assets require minimal maintenance, like a one-time investment, and are very suitable for side businesses.
