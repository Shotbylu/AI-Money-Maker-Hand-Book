# Ways to Earn Pocket Money by Selling Time Blocks

Here’s a summary of several methods that are suitable for earning extra cash by selling time blocks, based on an old article.

## Private Contracts

### Remote Outsourcing

One of the best ways to earn money is by taking on overseas projects, for example through platforms like [freelancer.com](http://freelancer.com). This not only allows you to earn in US dollars but also involves relatively simple tasks with manageable work hours. For instance, a WordPress plugin project for payment and registration functions could earn you $200–300 in a few days. Additionally, remote outsourcing projects tend to be more discreet.

Common Platforms:
- [freelancer.com](http://freelancer.com)
- [upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com/)

> Additional Info: Domestic platforms like [CODING 码市](https://mart.coding.net) are similar and connect developers with clients, offering payment guarantees.

However, platforms like "Zhubajie" are less suitable for programmers, as their projects often don't cater to professional developers.

### On-demand Hiring

On-demand hiring is a relatively new approach for private contracts. Developers can work for an employer on-site during their spare time, earning an hourly wage. This method eliminates the need for extensive negotiations and is ideal for programmers who don’t want to spend time on discussions.

Common Platforms:
- [Shixian.com](http://shixian.com): Offers flexible hourly employment but it’s recommended to avoid disclosing too much personal information in your profile to prevent unnecessary issues.
- Program Developer Hostel: A lesser-known on-demand hiring platform in China, but can still be used as a reference.

## Writing Articles

### Contributing for Money

Many programmers enjoy writing technical blogs and can monetize their content by contributing articles. For example, InfoQ accepts in-depth technical articles (3000–4000 words) with a pay rate of about 200 yuan per article. While the pay may not be substantial, it can cover the cost of an entry-level keyboard. Moreover, InfoQ has relatively lenient copyright policies, allowing articles to be republished on personal blogs or even used for books.

> Additional Info: Platforms like Weibo, WeChat, and JianShu also allow creators to receive tips, though JianShu’s approach may be somewhat problematic. Still, it's an option worth considering.

## Internal Referrals and Headhunter Recommendations

If you work for a top internet company (e.g., BAT), and have programmer friends who are frequently changing jobs, you can earn referral fees through internal or headhunter recommendations.

- **Internal Referrals**: Referral fees for internal recommendations are usually modest, ranging from 3000–6000 yuan. However, this is a reliable and low-risk method.
- **Headhunter Referrals**: Headhunter fees are higher. If you successfully refer a programmer with a 300,000 yuan annual salary, you could earn up to 10,000 yuan. However, headhunters typically require high-quality resumes, and the payout can take longer, usually after the probation period has passed.

These methods not only help you earn extra cash but can also enhance your relationship with your company.
