# Time Slot Optimization: Enhancing Efficiency per Unit of Time

## Boosting Efficiency through Automation

One key method to boost unit-time efficiency is through automation. For example, a task that originally took an hour to complete can now be done in the same time frame, but with more features or tasks being accomplished. This is a clear increase in efficiency.

Of course, relying solely on willpower to increase efficiency can be difficult. The most common strategy is to minimize distractions, maintain the continuity of our work, and keep things running smoothly. Achieving this is already an accomplishment. However, achieving a drastic boost in work efficiency can be tough.

Luckily, part of a programmer's job can be replaced by machines. This means we can use automation tools to enhance efficiency.

One example is code generators. Here, I’m not talking about large tools that generate entire project code, but rather tools that quickly generate various code snippets using templates that we’ve created.

Using scripts to generate code directly can achieve a similar result. Once we’ve converted the most time-consuming parts of daily development into templates, we can save a lot of time on future projects.

## Boosting Efficiency through AI

Code templates can only solve problems with fixed rules, but as artificial intelligence advances, many low-efficiency manual tasks can now be handled by AI.

For scenarios where AI's accuracy isn't high, we can combine human intervention to improve efficiency. For example, in image classification tasks, a process that originally took ten hours to complete manually can now be done by AI in ten minutes, though it might make 20% of errors. In this case, we could spend an additional two hours checking and fixing those errors. Despite this, the overall efficiency has increased fivefold.

Currently, AI services provided through APIs are becoming more and more reliable. For instance, I frequently use speech synthesis and recognition services to increase content production efficiency.

If the service is reliable enough, we can turn it into an automated service and offer it directly to users. If it’s not fully stable, we can incorporate it into our workflow to boost efficiency.

For example, code-generation technology might not work well if it's targeted at non-technical users and the service is incomplete. However, when designed for developers as a code completion and suggestion tool, the results are extremely valuable.

## Boosting Efficiency through Crowdsourcing and Outsourcing

Another way to enhance unit-time efficiency is through crowdsourcing. Essentially, crowdsourcing involves delegating tasks to others, and although we’ll need to spend time managing and overseeing the work, it can still significantly improve efficiency.

In simple terms, it's like creating a set of work nodes (workers), and we take on the role of both factory and manager. While scheduling and monitoring require effort, this approach breaks through time limitations.

It’s important to note that effectively crowdsourcing tasks is a skill in itself. For example, for part-time students, we can assign relatively simple tasks like data entry or organizing written content, and gradually increase the complexity. For experienced engineers, we can assign more complicated tasks such as independent microservices or components, ensuring minimal interdependence between tasks.

While monitoring and scheduling tasks requires some effort, this method can break through the limitation of working hours and is worth trying.

Additionally, we can see that directly selling time slots (charging by the hour) is usually the least profitable approach. Therefore, if we view work from the perspective of asset creation, we might identify more profitable ways to earn.
