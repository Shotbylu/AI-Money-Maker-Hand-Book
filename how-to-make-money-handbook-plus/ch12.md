In the past year, many paid column-style products have emerged, resembling a digital version of traditional publishing. These typically involve writing a series of up to ten articles, priced at half or even a third of traditional computer books. Paid columns are often available on exclusive platforms, so it's essential to choose the right platform to avoid wasting your work.

### Juejin "Small Books"

[Small Books](https://juejin.im/books) is a paid column product launched by Juejin. I was one of the first authors to try it, and it works great. You can write articles directly in Markdown, and after publishing, you can update them anytime to keep the content fresh. The pricing generally ranges from 19 to 29 yuan, and popular general content can sell over 1,000 copies, while niche content can still sell over 100 copies. It’s a great way to earn some extra pocket money.

### GitChat Columns

[GitChat Columns](https://gitbook.cn/gitchat/columns) is GitChat's paid column product. GitChat doesn't have a massive user base, but those who are willing to pay are likely to find good value—possibly because there isn’t much free content available.

### Xiao Column

I don’t know much about this platform, so I’m mentioning it here for reference.
