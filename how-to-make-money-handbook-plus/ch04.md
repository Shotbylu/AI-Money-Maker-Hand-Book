# Asset and Passive Income: Step 1 - How to Acquire Assets

First, we need to understand what an asset is. The definition of an asset can vary, but I adopt Robert Kiyosaki's definition in *Rich Dad Poor Dad*—"**something that generates income for you**" is an asset.

Because assets have this characteristic, they can generate wealth for you even when you’re asleep, shopping, or watching a movie.

*Rich Dad Poor Dad* is a book many people have read, and it talks about the mindset of the wealthy: the wealthy don’t work for money; they **make money work for them**.

In the book, Robert Kiyosaki primarily focuses on accumulating wealth through the "purchase" of assets. He lists several common types of assets:

- Stocks
- Bonds
- Income-generating real estate
- Notes (such as IOUs)
- Royalties (such as music, manuscripts, patents, etc.)
- Any other valuable item that has income potential, appreciation potential, and market demand

So, the book not only explains the types of assets but also encourages people to invest and manage their finances.

I’m not saying investing and managing money is bad, but it’s important to remember: **investing requires capital, and wealth management requires wealth**. Under controlled risks, the returns on most investments and financial management strategies do not vary greatly. If you don’t have a million in hand, even if you take big risks, the money you make in a year might only be a few thousand.

Among the asset categories in Robert’s list is one that can be acquired with “no cost”—royalties. However, in China, due to low book prices and weak copyright awareness, many companies blatantly infringe on copyrights, making royalties harder to achieve as expected.

If you haven’t accumulated wealth yet or don’t want to take on too much risk, how can you acquire assets? This question troubled me for a long time, but after graduating from college, I found an answer that is closely tied to technological development and the era’s opportunities.
