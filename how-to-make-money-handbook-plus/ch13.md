# Programmers Can Create: Paid Courses

- **Low Investment**: ★  
  Requires preparation time and possibly purchasing recording hardware later.  

- **High Returns**: ★★★★★  
  Users are willing to pay for quality courses.  

- **Sustainability**: ★★  
  Requires regular updates, especially for technical courses, which need updating about every six months.  

- **Low Risk**: ★★  
  Significant upfront investment, and if no one buys the course, you may incur losses. It's best to have a built-in audience.  

- **Moderate Barrier to Entry**: ★★★  
  Presentation experience is essential.

### Platform Sales  

#### Channels and Revenue Sharing  

Most platforms have confidentiality agreements, so details aren’t usually shared. However, revenue shares for platforms like NetEase Cloud Classroom and Udemy are publicly available and can be discussed.

#### NetEase Cloud Classroom  

NetEase offers three types of courses:  

- **Independent Listing**:  
  NetEase provides the platform (video upload, user management, payments, etc.), and you handle marketing. The revenue share is 50%.  
- **Premium Courses**:  
  NetEase helps with promotion, taking a higher share, often with exclusive rights (no other platforms).  
- **Micro-Specialties**:  
  A planned curriculum requiring deep cooperation from the start. These courses are highly promoted and yield the best returns.  

I placed my courses on NetEase for the following benefits:  

- Multiple payment channels, including options like Huabei, which are ideal for high-priced courses.  
- Built-in promotion system for affiliate marketing.

#### Udemy  

Udemy offers a 50% revenue share (5:5), but it supports global promotion. Users from China can only pay through PayPal, linked to a credit or debit card.

#### Tencent Classroom  

I do not recommend using Tencent Classroom. Although I received the Golden Cloud Award on NetEase, my application as an individual instructor was rejected three times by Tencent Classroom. I’ve heard that applying as an institution is easier, though it requires company credentials.

### Practical Sharing  

(Extracted from my long post: *How to Build a Tech Course That Earns 100K a Day*)  

#### Part 1  

Making courses is not as easy as it seems; there are many hidden challenges.  

**Fact 1**: *Creating a course is easy, selling it is hard*  
Many tech workers wonder why seemingly mediocre courses on IT course sites sell so well. They might think that creating a similar course will guarantee success.  

In reality, *a good course doesn’t necessarily sell well*. Courses are directly compared based on price, duration, and promises like job guarantees. This is a competitive market, especially for platform traffic, where trust is often built through branding.  

**Fact 2**: *Writing code makes more money than creating courses*  
Though top courses seem to sell well, most courses don’t generate significant income. A course priced at a few thousand yuan may only sell a few hundred copies. On average, course monthly income is about 20,000 yuan, while a programmer’s annual income can easily exceed 300,000 yuan with little risk.

**Fact 3**: *Piracy is the biggest competitor*  
Once your course becomes successful, piracy issues will arise. Piracy hurts revenue and damages the experience of legitimate users. Although platforms claim to have anti-piracy measures, they only act after you report the piracy, and it takes time to take down pirated content.  

To tackle this, I developed an interactive course system that improves the user experience and raises the cost of piracy.

#### Part 2  

Here’s how to go about it.  

**Topic Selection**  
Choosing the right topic determines the course’s audience. If your field is niche, it will be difficult to sell. Popular courses include Git, MySQL, and Docker. Deep-dive courses may have great reviews but often sell fewer copies.

**Pricing**  
Pricing depends on the value provided to students. For example, my full-stack course is priced at 3,000 yuan, aiming to increase job prospects for students.

**Presale and MVP**  
Presales can test market demand and assess the minimum possible earnings for your course. For example, my “Cute Cat·Roommate·Frontend Course” project didn’t perform well during the presale, so we discontinued the second season.  

We also use presale platforms to sell discount codes to ensure earnings won’t be too low.

#### Part 3  

Finally, the details of course production.  

**Course Outline**  
A solid outline saves time and ensures course quality. Be specific about each lesson's content—don’t just list the topics, but clearly define each section.

**Course Design**  
Organize the content visually, focusing on images rather than just text. Use tools like PowerPoint or Keynote to visualize the course material.

**Software Tools**  
For Mac users, **Keynote** and **iMovie** are great for course recording. For screen recording, **OBS** is recommended as it supports multiple platforms.

**Machine Voice**  
To cut costs, consider using machine-generated voiceovers for course narration. This works well for converting personal traffic but has a limited effect on platform traffic.

By selecting the right topics, pricing strategically, and using presale tactics, you can effectively control the risks of course creation and sales.
