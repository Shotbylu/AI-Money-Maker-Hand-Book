# Clarifying Your Core Resources

When I first wrote this content, it was a bit casual—I just listed the channels I had come across. But after revisiting it, I realized that while there was a lot of content, it didn’t really get to the core of things.

Some people might wonder, “What core resources are there to talk about when making pocket money?” 🤷🏻‍♂️ They might think it's just a self-media person “pretending.” I used to think that way too, but after giving it more thought, I realized there’s actually a good reason behind it.

Our theme is: **How can programmers elegantly make pocket money?** There are two main points here: “**pocket money**” and “**elegance**.”

### What is “Pocket Money”?

“Pocket money” implies that this work is a **side hustle**—we still have a main job. What is a side hustle? It’s something we do in the limited time we squeeze out from our busy work and life. So, when we’re making pocket money, what is the most valuable resource? **Time**.

Why is that? Because businesses have a lot of resources and can hire people to extend time, whereas for side hustles, both our energy and resources are limited. Side hustles usually don’t pay much, and if we need to hire people, the earnings per person decrease, and there’s even a risk of not making enough. Additionally, having more people increases communication costs.

Thus, **time is the most limited and hardest resource to expand when it comes to side hustles**. We need to plan how to make money with our limited time as the core resource.

### What is “Elegance”?

“Elegance” means that we not only need to make money but also do so in a relaxed manner—without letting the side hustle become more exhausting than the main job. This requires strategy and method, which is closely tied to **time optimization**.
