### Selling Digital Assets Like a Creator  

Just like writers publish books and musicians compose songs, programmers can create copyrighted digital content and earn revenue from sales.  

While the domestic market often overlooks copyright-based transactions, there is still significant global demand, especially in the English-speaking market.  

For example, Envato operates popular marketplaces like **[ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net)** for templates and **[CodeCanyon](https://codecanyon.net)** for plugins.  

## Example: ThemeForest  

ThemeForest is a massive marketplace for templates, offering over **47,000 WordPress and HTML themes**, with prices starting as low as **$2 per template**.  

In some regions, even high-quality templates struggle to sell due to piracy and free distribution.  

However, in the international market, users are more willing to pay for properly licensed templates and plugins because the cost is reasonable, and using pirated versions carries higher risks.  

Personally, I often purchase templates from ThemeForest. At first, I thought the market was small—until I checked the sales figures of one of the top-selling templates.  

This particular template includes a **built-in page builder** and sells for **$60 per copy**.  

Since its launch on **August 16, 2012**, it has sold **585,840 copies**, generating total revenue of approximately **$35.15 million** (about **200 million RMB**). And this is just one template—the company sells multiple other templates as well.  

### A Massive Opportunity in WordPress  

Many believe PHP is outdated, but in reality, **one-third of the top 10 million websites worldwide still run on WordPress**—making it a massive market.  

### Low-Cost Entry for Developers  

One of the biggest advantages of creating templates and plugins is that they often start as byproducts of other work.  

For example:  
- A **template system** developed for a freelance project.  
- A **custom plugin** built for personal blogs.  

By simply **packaging and commercializing these tools**, developers can generate additional income with minimal extra effort.
