# Time Slot Optimization: Enhancing Unit-Time Earnings

When it comes to "optimizing time slots," there are two primary strategies. The first is **increasing the earnings per unit of time**.

## Strategy to Increase Earnings per Unit of Time

The logic is straightforward: since increasing the number of time slots is difficult, we should focus on maximizing earnings from each time slot. For instance, when doing outsourcing, choosing higher-paying clients can be a way to earn more.

### Switching to International Outsourcing

One way to increase earnings is by engaging in international outsourcing. Compared to domestic outsourcing, labor costs abroad are usually higher, while our costs tend to be lower. This price gap presents an opportunity for higher earnings, provided the price gap is well-managed.

However, to handle international work, having the ability to communicate in foreign languages is essential. If you don’t have this skill, you may need to either abandon the market or learn a foreign language to improve your capabilities.

### Moving from Outsourcing to Secondary Development

Yet, without a recognized reputation, the outsourcing market can often be competitive on price. Some are willing to work for lower rates, and outsourcing projects often require knowledge of a wide range of technical skills. Additionally, many high-quality outsourcing projects are not publicly listed and are typically obtained through industry recommendations or personal referrals.

To mitigate these issues, you could consider **narrowing your development focus and specializing in a niche market** by working on secondary development for open-source products. This strategy is not new—early on, developers made money by providing secondary development for platforms like Discuz!

We can expand on this idea by shifting the focus from domestic projects to internationally recognized projects. This strategy helps avoid common issues encountered when "going global," such as sourcing users. The answer is open-source communities. How can you prove your skills? By writing high-quality open-source plugins. How do you earn higher returns? Because there are few people focusing on writing plugins for specific projects.

### Switching to a More Profitable Business Model

If we can control how we sell our time slots, we can also increase our earnings by adopting a more lucrative business model.

For example, I’ve been asked by many students why I don’t offer one-on-one high-end courses or live-streamed classes. From the perspective of time slots, the reason becomes clear. If I offer one-on-one courses, although each client pays more, my time can only be dedicated to that one client. **However, if I offer a one-to-many course, the earning potential increases significantly**. Even though the individual earnings per student might be lower, the total accumulated earnings from multiple students can result in higher overall income.

Live-streamed courses follow a similar logic. Each live session consumes our time slots, while pre-recorded courses only require recording once and don’t take up any more time afterward. In terms of time-slot utilization, pre-recorded courses are more efficient.

Of course, this is a commercial model analysis, and the specific situation may differ. Some live-streamed courses may be very profitable, while pre-recorded courses may not attract many viewers. Live-streaming can also bring in additional revenue through product sales.

Many course platforms are using live streaming to attract new users. In this case, live-streaming courses are, in effect, a form of advertising to solve marketing problems, which involves a different logic altogether.
