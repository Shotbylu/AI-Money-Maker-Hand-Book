# Suitable Asset for Programmers: Book Publishing

### Advantages Analysis

- **Low Investment**: Writing a book demands substantial content and time investment, with a longer cycle.
- **High Returns**: ★★★ Royalties typically range from 8% to 10%, but publishing a book can significantly boost your visibility.
- **Sustainability**: ★★★★ Books are not updated frequently, making them a sustainable asset over time.
- **Low Risk**: ★★★★ While income might be modest, the risks involved are low.
- **Low Entry Barriers**: ★★★★ ★ You will need publisher support, and there’s a certain threshold for e-book publishing.

### Recommended Tools for Writing

Choosing the right tools for writing a book is crucial. If you’re writing a technical book, I recommend using **Markdown** editors. Particularly, GitBook stands out for the following reasons:

- Supports Markdown syntax with real-time previews
- Automatically generates PDF, Mobi, and ePub formats
- Can create a web version of the book

GitBook has recently transitioned to an online service but also offers a local editor. The previous local version had a couple of small bugs:

1. When creating a new chapter, you couldn't directly use Chinese characters; you'd need to type in English first, then switch to Chinese.
2. Sometimes, when mixing Chinese and English text in a line, text overlaps during line breaks.

If these issues hinder your workflow, you can generate the MD file in GitBook and continue writing with other editors. GitBook’s strength lies in its ability to easily drag and drop to adjust the order of chapters.

For publishing, you can either upload your files to the cloud for GitBook to handle the format conversion or do the conversion locally yourself.

### Publishing Channels

#### Self-Sale

You can list your book on digital goods platforms, create a product page, and sell it directly.

#### E-book Platforms

##### Duokan and Amazon

These platforms do not have direct submission options but can be accessed via agents. I use **BookDNA**.

- BookDNA offers paid services, including book sales revenue shares and layout fees (around 500 yuan). Their layout is meticulous, handling images, footnotes, and external links excellently.
- After uploading the book, BookDNA will review it, and once approved, you’ll sign a contract and receive payment. The process is quicker with Amazon, usually around 20 days, but Duokan and Douban take longer.

BookDNA also distributes books to Baidu, Taobao, Douban, and other platforms, which I recommend doing together.

The downside of BookDNA is that sales feedback is slower, and you can’t view real-time sales like on Baidu Reading. Additionally, e-book rights are given to them, so evaluate the risks accordingly.

#### Physical Book Publishing

If your e-book sells well, you can consider publishing a physical book. You can submit your e-book to a publisher or, if you're lucky, a publisher may contact you directly.

Many people think that books with a small word count can’t be published. However, publishers are willing to publish books with 20,000 to 30,000 words. 

This is great news! Many technical books stretch to meet the required word count by adding appendices or cramming in unrelated topics. Now, you can focus on a niche area and target a specific audience.

### Conclusion

Compared to blog posts, books allow you to express your ideas more systematically and showcase your expertise. Leveraging social networks and online publishing platforms, we can also receive real-time feedback from readers.

I suggest writing a series of blog posts and eventually compiling them into a book. This way, you won’t pressure your time but can impact your target audience early on, growing your potential readership and achieving multiple benefits.
